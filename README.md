## Legacy version driver
Raspberry Pi is transitioning from a legacy camera software stack based on proprietary Broadcom GPU code to an open-source stack based on libcamera. Raspberry Pi OS images from Bullseye onwards will contain only the libcamera-based stack. In order to connect the new system and libcamera, we developed the Pivariety V4L2 driver.
