# Introduction
The MIPI cameras are widely used nowdays for smart phones and many opensource platforms like Raspberry pi and Nvidia Jetson series boards.
And in order to add more mipi cameras support for these maker hardware paltforms while keeping the mipi camera complex interface and protocol hidden from user, 
Arducam team developed several camera drivers and demo code based on our software SDK.

I (65sc02) added an improved version of the arducamstill program which allows to set more parameters and does really what it promises. Let me know if you like it!
